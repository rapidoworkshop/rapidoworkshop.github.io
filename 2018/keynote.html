    Self-Awareness for Heterogeneous MPSoCs:A Case Study using Adaptive, Reflective Middleware
	</strong><br/>	    
	by Nikil DUTT, UC Irvine
    </h2>
    <p>
    <strong>Abstract</strong> 
    Self-awareness has a long history in biology, psychology, medicine, engineering and (more recently) computing. In the past decade this has inspired new self-aware strategies for emerging computing substrates (e.g., complex heterogeneous MPSoCs) that must cope with the (often conflicting) challenges of resiliency, energy, heat, cost, performance, security, etc. in the face of highly dynamic operational behaviors and environmental conditions.  Earlier we had championed the concept of CyberPhysical-Systems-on-Chip (CPSoC), a new class of sensor-actuator rich many-core computing platforms that intrinsically couples on-chip and cross-layer sensing and actuation to enable self-awareness. Unlike traditional MPSoCs, CPSoC is distinguished by an intelligent co-design of the control, communication, and computing (C3) system that interacts with the physical environment in real-time in order to modify the system’s behavior so as to adaptively achieve desired objectives and Quality-of-Service (QoS). The CPSoC design paradigm enables self-awareness (i.e., the ability of the system to observe its own internal and external behaviors such that it is capable of making judicious decision) and (opportunistic) adaptation using the concept of cross-layer physical and virtual sensing and actuations applied across different layers of the hardware/software system stack. The closed loop control used for adaptation to dynamic variation -- commonly known as the observe-decide-act (ODA) loop -- is implemented using an adaptive, reflective middleware layer.
    
    In this talk I will present a case study of this adaptive, reflective middleware layer using a holistic approach for performing resource allocation decisions and power management by leveraging concepts from reflective software. Reflection enables dynamic adaptation based on both external feedback and introspection (i.e., self-assessment). In our context, this translates into performing resource management actuation considering both sensing information (e.g., readings from performance counters, power sensors, etc.) to assess the current system state, as well as models to predict the behavior of other system components before performing an action. I will summarize results leveraging our adaptive-reflective middleware toolchain to i) perform energy-efficient task mapping on heterogeneous architectures, ii) explore the design space of novel HMP architectures, and iii) extend the lifetime of mobile devices.

		Cross-Layer system-level reliability Estimation
        </strong><br/>	    
	by Alberto BOSIO, LIRMM
    </h2>
    <p>
    <strong>Abstract</strong>
Cross-layer approach is becoming the preferred solution when reliability is a concern in the design of a microprocessor-based system. Nevertheless, deciding how to distribute the error management across the different layers of the system is a very complex task that requires the support of dedicated frameworks for cross-layer reliability analysis. In other words, the designer has to know what are the “critical” components of the system in order to properly introduce error management mechanisms. Unfortunately, system-level reliability estimation is a complex task that usually requires huge simulation campaign. This presentation aims at proposing a cross-layer system-level reliability analysis framework for soft-errors in microprocessor-based systems. The framework exploits a multi-level hybrid Bayesian model to describe the target system and takes advantage of Bayesian inference to estimate different reliability metrics.  
Experimental results, carried out on different microprocessor architectures (i.e., Intel x86, ARM Cortex-A15, ARM Cortex-A9), show that the simulation time is significantly lower than state-of-the-art fault-injection experiments with an accuracy high enough to take effective design decision.

Specific needs for the modelling and the refinement of CPU and FPGA platforms
        </strong><br/>	    
	by Guy Bois, Polytechnique Montréal and President of Space Codesign Systems 
    </h2>
    <p>
    <strong>Abstract</strong>
We are currently witnessing a trend in the democratization of tightly coupled CPU+FPGA platforms to a wider population of users, such as the software developer community. In this context, we present  a system design flow process targetting  CPU and FPGA platforms. After an overview of existing modelling approaches and their limitations for FPGA, we present our  methodology based on C/C++ specifications that automatically generates virtual platform for different Hw/Sw partitioning, while integrating monitoring and analysis capabilities for performance profiling. We also show how we can achieve the architectural implementation (complete system generation for the physical platform), mainly by leveraging tools from FPGA vendors that perform the low-level synthesis and the bitstream generation.

Building Smart SoCs - Using Virtual Prototyping for the Design of SoCs with Artificial Intelligence Accelerators
        </strong><br/>	    
	by Tim Kogel, Synopsys
    </h2>
    <p>
    <strong>Abstract</strong>
Artificial Intelligence enables a whole new range of applications in the areas of Virtual and Augmented Reality, robotics, IoT, healthcare, mobile, automotive, and others. In particular, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have enabled quantum leaps in brain-like functions such as speech and image recognition.
The design of tailored SoC platforms for training and inference of Artificial Intelligence applications is very challenging. The fast pace of innovation and differentiation of AI applications requires high flexibility in the underlying architecture to support evolving AI algorithms with varying number of layers, filters, channels, and filter sizes. Also, the execution of AI algorithms like Neural Network graphs requires very high computational performance and memory bandwidth. In addition to flexibility and performance, embedded applications, especially mobile devices, need to have low power consumption.
As Moore’s Law does no longer deliver 2x transistors every 2 years at same price, the necessary improvements in power, performance, and flexibility need to come from better architectures:
- Customization of the micro-architecture to the algorithmic kernels
- Designing the macro-architecture with the right level of block-level parallelism to achieve the desired throughput.
- Selecting the best data flow for the Neural Network based on the data handling characteristics.
- Optimizing the implementation of the data transfers with tailored DMA engines and local buffering to get the most out of the limited bandwidth to the external memory.
The last item is particularly important, because most Neural Network algorithms are memory-bandwidth limited. This presentation will show, how Virtual Prototyping can help to design accelerators for Artificial Intelligence and integrate them into the SoC context.
