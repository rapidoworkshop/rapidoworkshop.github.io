    <p>The focus of the RAPIDO Workshop is on methods and tools for rapid
    simulation and performance evaluation in embedded and high performance
    systems design.
    Given continuous advances in chip technology, it is to be expected that
    future-generation processors will integrate numerous units on a single die,
    including multiple processor cores, multiple levels of (shared/private)
    caches or memories, and multiple dedicated accelerators, which will be glued
    together through a network on-chip (NoC).
    </p>

    <p>The design space is huge though:<br />
    <ul>
      <li>How many cores do we need?</li>
      <li>Should we have a homogeneous or a heterogeneous design?</li>
      <li>When dynamic reconfiguration must be performed?</li>
      <li>How many caches/memories do we need?</li>
      <li>How to choose the instruction set(s) for these cores?</li>
      <li>What are the best code optimizations for a given application?</li>
      <li>How to combine the different metrics (e.g. energy, latency and
      throughput) into a global search space?</li>
    </ul></p>

    <p>All these design questions lead to a huge design space that needs to be
    explored and which poses a grand challenge to search this space and to deliver
    an optimal design within the tight time-to-market budget.
    </p>

    <p>In the embedded domain, the Intellectual Property (IP) based design approach
    is one of the most popular solutions to overcome this design challenge by
    relying on parameterized, pre-designed and pre-verified IP cores.
    Simulators are then used to explore the huge design space of interconnected IP
    cores for finding the optimal design for a given application domain.
    </p>

    <p>In the general-purpose computing domain, the time-to-market is typically
    longer, the design is typically not limited to interconnecting pre-existing IP
    cores, however, the design should be optimized for a broader set of
    applications.
    </p>

    <p>In both the embedded and the general-purpose domains, searching the huge
    design space during the design process is done through Design Space Exploration
    (DSE).
    DSE involves a number of key technologies such as modeling, simulation,
    prototyping, heuristic searching, etc. which have to cooperate in order to make
    the exploration effective, i.e., to obtain a final design with an optimal
    performance/power/cost/reliability ratio for the application domain of interest
    without compromising the time-to-market.
    </p>

    <p>Although DSE is essential to both embedded and general-purpose processor
    design, both communities are largely unaware of each otherâ€™s work and progress.
    The purpose of this workshop therefore is to bridge this gap, and bring
    together researchers and practitioners from both communities to learn and
    discuss recent progress, and stimulate the interaction between both communities
    by exchanging ideas and sharing experiences. The workshop should provide a
    forum for brainstorming and road-mapping future DSE technologies for both the
    embedded and general-purpose domains.
