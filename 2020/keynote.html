Towards Self-Aware Systems-on-Chip Through Intelligent Cross-Layer Coordination	</strong><br/>	    
Fadi J Kurdahi - University of California, Irvine     
</h2>
    <p>
    <strong>Abstract</strong> 
Although there is a rich history of cross-layer design for embedded computing systems to achieve desired QoS, we are facing ever more challenges from the intertwined goals of energy- efficiency, thermal design constraints, as well as resilience to errors emanating from the application, environment and hardware platforms. We posit that next-generation computing platforms must necessarily deploy intelligent cross-layer design achieved through self-awareness principles inspired by biology and nature.  Such an approach will move us from current strategies (using limited cross-layer coordination) to a holistic cross-layer strategy that enables intelligent cross-layer management policies which can adaptively tune itself based on the current state of the system. The talk will present design exemplars that embrace this intelligent cross-layer approach, and highlight the role of self-awareness in achieving dynamic adaptivity.

	Digital twin for cyber physical systems
	</strong><br/>	    
	Reda Nouacer - CEA LIST    
</h2>
    <p>
    <strong>Abstract</strong> 
Since the first use of the word "Digital-Twin" by Michael Grieves in a 2003, several research publications have addressed the technical obstacles underlying the implementation of this concept. In parallel with these academic research works, several industrial research projects have been undertaken for an evaluation in real or representative conditions of this approach. Certain sectors, such as nuclear and aeronautics, exploit digital twins throughout the life cycle of their products and in particular for the training of operating or maintenance personnel.Today the proof is made of the usefulness of the digital twin but unfortunately we note that the deployment of this approach is limited to a few areas of application and only the category of large industrial groups have access to it but in limited usages.The objective of the presentation is, firstly, to review the theoretical foundations and known uses of the digital twin in the field of CPS. Then to expose, in a second part, the blocking points to a massive deployment of this approach in the industrial world. The presentation ends with the proposal of the economic model MSaaS (Modeling and Simulation as a Service) which should answer a certain number of the identified problems and allow the emergence of an agile ecosystem to meet the needs of the industry in this field.

Security for Machine Learning: The Intelligence Features of Your Smart Cyber Physical Systems are under Attack!	
</strong><br/>	    
Muhammad Shafique - TU Wien    </h2>
    <p>
    <strong>Abstract</strong> 
Access to massive amounts of data and high-end computers has heralded revolutionary advances in Machine Learning (ML) impacting domains ranging from autonomous driving and robotics, to healthcare, the natural sciences, the arts and beyond. As we deploy modern ML systems in safety- and health-care applications, however, it is important to ensure their security against adversarial attacks. Researchers have shown that many modern ML algorithms, especially the ones based on the deep neural networks (DNNs) are fragile and can be embarrassingly easy to fool. This is easier said than done. Recent research has shown that DNNs are susceptible to a range of attacks including adversarial input perturbations, backdoors, Trojans, and fault attacks. This can create catastrophic effects for various safety-critical applications like automotive, healthcare, etc. For instance, self-driving cars and vehicular networks, which heavily rely on ML-based functions, exhibit a wide attack surface that can be exploited by well-known and yet-unknown-but-possible attacks on ML models. DNNs contain hundreds of millions of parameters and are hard to interpret/debug let alone verify, significantly increasing the chance they may misbehave. Further, any ML system is only as robust as the data on which we train it on. If the data distributions change in the field, this can impair performance (for example, an autonomous vehicle trained in day time conditions may not function at nighttime).The goal of this talk is to shed light on various security threats for the ML algorithms, especially the deep neural networks (DNNs). Various security attacks and defenses for DNNs will be presented in detail. Afterwards, open research problem and perspectives will be briefly discussed.
